<b>Title</b>: The Effect of Community Organizing on Landlords’ Use of Eviction Filing: Evidence from U.S. Cities<br>
<b>Authors</b>: Andrew Messamore<br>
<b>Abstract</b>: Eviction filing rates have declined in many large cities in the United States. Existing scholarship on eviction, which focuses on discrete tenant-landlord relationships, has few explanations for this decline. I
consider whether community organizing by nonprofit organizations shapes the social organization of
communities and causes landlords to file fewer eviction filings. In cities where tenant and anti-poverty
organizing has become common, community-oriented nonprofit organizations advocate for disadvantaged communities and help residents avoid poverty. Community organizing has rarely been studied as a
predictor of housing security among low-income tenants, despite studies of how community organizing
shapes the use of property in wealthy neighborhoods. I estimate the causal effect of community organizations on eviction filing rates between 2000 and 2016 using longitudinal data and a strategy to account for
the endogeneity of nonprofits and eviction. Evidence from year-to-year models in 75 large cities spanning
sixteen years estimate that an addition of ten community nonprofits in a city of 100,000 residents is associated with a ten percent reduction in eviction filing. This effect is comparable to the effect of community
organizations on murder and is roughly a third of the association between eviction and concentrated
disadvantage.

<b>Title</b>: TBD<br>
<b>Authors</b>: Arturo Baiocchi<br>
<b>Biography</b>: Dr. Baiocchi is an Associate Professor at the School of Social Work at Sacramento State and a Faculty Fellow at the Center for Health Policy, Practice, and Research (CHPRR). His research focuses on vulnerable young adults, mental health, and homelessness. He also teaches course in social welfare policy, homelessness, and community-based research.
In the past seven years, Dr. Baiocchi, along with colleagues, have drafted a series of academic publications and community reports on the prevalence and response to homelessness in Sacramento County and across the state (e.g., reports for the CA Dept of Social Services, CA Interagency Council on Homelessness, US Bureau of Justice, Sacramento Continuum of Care, CA Health Foundation). Notably, Dr. Baiocchi was the lead author of the 2022 report “State of Homelessness in Sacramento County,” which highlighted pronounced trends in growing numbers of individuals experiencing homelessness in Sacramento, ongoing racial disparities, as well as the disconnect and marginalization that many individuals living on the street feel toward policies to address homelessness. His research has been highlighted in the Sacramento Bee, the Los Angeles Times, the Chris=an Science Monitor, Kaiser Health News, Capital Public Radio, CalMatters, and other media. In October 2022, Dr. Baiocchi received the Homeless Justice Champion of the Year award from the Sacramento Housing Alliance.

<b>Title</b>: A Prolonged State of Emergency for Homelessness? The 2015 Proclamations in Seattle and
the Exercise of Symbolic Power<br>
<b>Authors</b>: Selen Güler and Devin Collins (co-first authors)<br>
<b>Abstract</b>: In fast-growing urban centers, growing homelessness has emerged as a vexing issue confronting
local leaders. While poverty governance scholars assert that state actors respond by embracing
strategies of punitive containment, overt criminalization may be untenable in the socially
progressive cities experiencing some of the highest rates of homelessness in the county. Through
an in-depth archival analysis of the 2015 State of Emergency (SOE) on homelessness in Seattle
and King County, this study centers a case in which policymakers neither “normalized”
homelessness nor openly projected commitments to punishment. Instead, the SOE framed
homelessness as a social and economic catastrophe brought about by rapid growth, housing
unaffordability, and policy failure. Despite this framing, immediate post-emergency policies
remained narrowly focused on punitive, short-term interventions targeting the physical and
administrative visibility of homelessness rather than its structural drivers. Drawing on Bourdieu’s
theory of the state, we interpret the SOE and subsequent policies as an exercise of symbolic
power stemming from officials’ need to reconcile the fiscal and social contradictions that
increasing homelessness presents. By interrogating the disjuncture between official discourse and
policy, this study offers new insights on the operation of social control and crisis mitigation in
contemporary neoliberal cities.
